### Mentor's corner

We've asked the mentors from Saturday's Hour of Code for advice or words of encouragement. Here's what they had to say:

  > “Keep going! Look for tasks that you perform on your computer that are ripe for automation, and use your programming skills to dispense with them for good.”

    “If you had fun, keep at it. I started out making little games on my family's computer, and over 15 years later, I still enjoy it.“

  > “Pick something simple to build and use that as a focal point for learning rather than trying to learn a language and then build something with it.”

    “Programming can be a really rewarding experience, and there's no limit to what you can do with it.”
