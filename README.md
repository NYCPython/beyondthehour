### Mentor's corner

We've asked the mentors from Saturday's Hour of Code for advice or words of encouragement. Here's what they had to say:

    “Keep going! Look for tasks that you perform on your computer 
    that are ripe for automation, and use your programming skills 
    to dispense with them for good.”

            “If you had fun, keep at it. I started out making little games 
            on my family's computer, and over 15 years later, I still 
            enjoy it.“

    “Pick something simple to build and use that as a focal point 
    for learning rather than trying to learn a language and then 
    build something with it.”

            “Programming can be a really rewarding experience, and there's 
            no limit to what you can do with it.”

### What can you do with coding?

Here's just a few ideas of what you can do with coding!

You can interface with hardware, build robots, or build custom games:<br/>

You can use programming to study the human mind, make your dream idea, or change careers (even at 55!):
